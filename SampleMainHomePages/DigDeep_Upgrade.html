  <h3 style="color:black;background-color:gold"> Here I'm gonna introduce my mindset to you. 

Before reading it, "Make some peace for your sub-conscious mind and let your dopamine release positive neurons" ~_~ It's okay. </h3>

<p>1) I love to rap. I write rap lyrics and try to do freestyle sometimes, not a pro though!

 One of the Eminem's biggest fan. I love his rap and he's a role model for me. 

Damn! His lyrics <3 

Every time I fall in a pit with no kit, 

Imma listen to his shit and make it lit. </p>

<p>2) I hate studying. But I love learning <3 

     I still don't know why this educational system testing the memory of students these days while we even forget the things in our list, to bring from a market :/ </p>
	 
<p>3) Coding is interesting to me.I don't know why people feel sick when they feel "Coding".

 Damn! You won't be even getting likes to your profile pic and make some edits to it without us. Without our programming, you're sick. (No offense. Everybody has their own taste and their own unique talents.) </p>

<p>4) GAMER. Yeah! I love PC gaming. Especially Online multiplayer gaming and Game with a good story. The most important things in a game are Story, Graphics, Length and Soundtrack. I used to play Counter-Strike 1.6. Now? You know...Assignments, Records, Exams, Blah! :'D

 Gaming is not a crime. They boost your mind skills(Not all category games!) </p>

<p>5) My favorite TV show: "FRIENDS". Damn! That's sarcastic, lovely and funny. Already a fan of it? -"Hey! How you doin'?"

 No? You gotta give it a try to it then ;) </p>

Finally, a person with a set of skills but can cook NOTHING.Even Maggi. 

I end up here saying that I like to be neat but I strew things in my room haphazardly reckless. :/ 

Need to learn that. Thank you :)
